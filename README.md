# Ruby_rails_Dashboard

In this project, I tried to create a dashboard, you can create the list of different Institute and each Institute have some students, by clicking Institute you can see the individual information about The Institute and how many students are enrolled in particular Institute. 
even you can create new Institute, after creating it. you can delete edit and modify it,
same for the students you can create new student and you have a control deleted or modified. if you have any question regarding this code feel free to drop me an e-mail and you can use this code for your own project. mgullfaraz@gmail.com
